# ðŸ“„ Multi-modal RAG Pipeline with LangChain

**Tagline:** An advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying complex, multi-modal documents, integrating Text, Tables, and Images using LangChain.

### Project Overview

This repository features a robust implementation of a **Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. Designed to move beyond traditional text-only data processing, this solution enables highly contextual and accurate question-answering over complex documents, such as PDFs containing varied content structures.

The core innovation lies in leveraging sophisticated document parsing to segment content into discrete, queryable elementsâ€”including text, structured tables, and embedded imagesâ€”before vectorizing and storing them for retrieval.
